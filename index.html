            <p class="text-paragraph">"The person who never did a mistake never tried to do something creative" says Albert Einstein. He is the person who made our world developed. He even won the Nobel Prize for physics. He was born 14 March 1889 in Ulm, Germany. His father's name was Herman Einstein who was a engineer and a salesman. When Einstein was born, that time his head was bigger than normal new-born babies. From childhood, he was very calm. He never did mischievous things. Einstein could not speak till the age of 4. Till the age of 9, he could not speak that properly. Einstein's parents were worried that would happen to him in the future. He never liked to play. He made his new world. He always waited for Sunday because on Sundays Einstein's father would take him to a peaceful place where he would think about the trees, plants and the universe. He always used to think how this world works. He went to school very late. He used to think school was a jail. His feelings were like we are never free at school. He never used to agree with the teachers because he used to think that there were leaving something while explaining. He used to ask teachers very complicated questions.</p>

            <p class="text-paragraph">So, teachers were very obsessed with Einstein they started calling Einstein mad. So, Einstein started think how develop his mind. Once, he asked his teacher how develop his brain. Teacher told, "Practice is the key to success." He decided that he will defeat everyone in studies. After that, he mastered Maths and Physics. He showed that a mad person can also become great by hard work. He used to create the final result of a problem in his mind. Albert Einstein was offered to be the president of Israel. But he rejected the offer. American's used to keep a secret spy behind Einstein. He always used to think good about people. He died on 18th April 1955 at the age of 75. His last words are a mystery because he told his last words in German.</p>
